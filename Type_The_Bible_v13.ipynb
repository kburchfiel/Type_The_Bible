    "Note: This section used to include code that would calculate the fastest single-word entry times. However, I found that these results could be distorted by computer lag. Specifically, if the player enters keys while the computer is frozen, some of those keypress durations will be reported as shorter than they actually were. (This makes sense, in that while the computer is frozen, the actual keypress time might not get logged; instead, a later post-freeze time will get logged. This post-freeze time will then be closer to the next keypress time, causing a shorter-than-actual keypress time to get reported.) (I simulated computer lag in my tests by entering a time.sleep() command, but I believe actual lag would produce similar errors). These skewed keypress durations can in turn skew the reported time needed to enter each word.\n",

    "Therefore, while the code still shows median word entry times (which are less susceptible to this issue), it will no longer calculate the fastest times that a particular word was entered. These can still be located within the word stats file, but the results should be interpreted with great caution."
