1 Timothy.
Chapter 2.
I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and givings of thanks be made for all men, 
for kings and all who are in high places, that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and reverence. 
For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, 
who desires all people to be saved and come to full knowledge of the truth. 
For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, 
who gave himself as a ransom for all, the testimony at the proper time, 
to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle—I am telling the truth in Christ, not lying—a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. 
I desire therefore that the men in every place pray, lifting up holy hands without anger and doubting. 
In the same way, that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and propriety, not with braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive clothing, 
but with good works, which is appropriate for women professing godliness. 
Let a woman learn in quietness with full submission. 
But I don’t permit a woman to teach, nor to exercise authority over a man, but to be in quietness. 
For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 
Adam wasn’t deceived, but the woman, being deceived, has fallen into disobedience; 
but she will be saved through her childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and holiness with sobriety.
