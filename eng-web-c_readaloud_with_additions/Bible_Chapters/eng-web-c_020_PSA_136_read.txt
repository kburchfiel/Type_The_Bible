Psalms.
Chapter 136.
Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, for his loving kindness endures forever. 
Give thanks to the God of gods, for his loving kindness endures forever. 
Give thanks to the Lord of lords, for his loving kindness endures forever; 
to him who alone does great wonders, for his loving kindness endures forever; 
to him who by understanding made the heavens, for his loving kindness endures forever; 
to him who spread out the earth above the waters, for his loving kindness endures forever; 
to him who made the great lights, for his loving kindness endures forever; 
the sun to rule by day, for his loving kindness endures forever; 
the moon and stars to rule by night, for his loving kindness endures forever; 
to him who struck down the Egyptian firstborn, for his loving kindness endures forever; 
and brought out Israel from among them, for his loving kindness endures forever; 
with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, for his loving kindness endures forever; 
to him who divided the Red Sea apart, for his loving kindness endures forever; 
and made Israel to pass through the middle of it, for his loving kindness endures forever; 
but overthrew Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea, for his loving kindness endures forever; 
to him who led his people through the wilderness, for his loving kindness endures forever; 
to him who struck great kings, for his loving kindness endures forever; 
and killed mighty kings, for his loving kindness endures forever; 
Sihon king of the Amorites, for his loving kindness endures forever; 
Og king of Bashan, for his loving kindness endures forever; 
and gave their land as an inheritance, for his loving kindness endures forever; 
even a heritage to Israel his servant, for his loving kindness endures forever; 
who remembered us in our low estate, for his loving kindness endures forever; 
and has delivered us from our adversaries, for his loving kindness endures forever; 
who gives food to every creature, for his loving kindness endures forever. 
Oh give thanks to the God of heaven, for his loving kindness endures forever.
