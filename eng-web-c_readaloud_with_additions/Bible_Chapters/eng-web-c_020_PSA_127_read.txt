Psalms.
Chapter 127.
A Song of Ascents. By Solomon. Unless the LORD builds the house, they who build it labor in vain. Unless the LORD watches over the city, the watchman guards it in vain. 
It is vain for you to rise up early, to stay up late, eating the bread of toil, for he gives sleep to his loved ones. 
Behold, children are a heritage of the LORD. The fruit of the womb is his reward. 
As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of youth. 
Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them. They won’t be disappointed when they speak with their enemies in the gate.
