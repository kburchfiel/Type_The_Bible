Psalms.
Chapter 56.
For the Chief Musician. To the tune of “Silent Dove in Distant Lands.” A poem by David, when the Philistines seized him in Gath. Be merciful to me, God, for man wants to swallow me up. All day long, he attacks and oppresses me. 
My enemies want to swallow me up all day long, for they are many who fight proudly against me. 
When I am afraid, I will put my trust in you. 
In God, I praise his word. In God, I put my trust. I will not be afraid. What can flesh do to me? 
All day long they twist my words. All their thoughts are against me for evil. 
They conspire and lurk, watching my steps. They are eager to take my life. 
Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger cast down the peoples, God. 
You count my wanderings. You put my tears into your container. Aren’t they in your book? 
Then my enemies shall turn back in the day that I call. I know this: that God is for me. 
In God, I will praise his word. In the LORD, I will praise his word. 
I have put my trust in God. I will not be afraid. What can man do to me? 
Your vows are on me, God. I will give thank offerings to you. 
For you have delivered my soul from death, and prevented my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living.
