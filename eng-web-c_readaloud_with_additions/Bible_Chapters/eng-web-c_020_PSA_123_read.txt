Psalms.
Chapter 123.
A Song of Ascents. I lift up my eyes to you, you who sit in the heavens. 
Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the LORD, our God, until he has mercy on us. 
Have mercy on us, LORD, have mercy on us, for we have endured much contempt. 
Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who are at ease, with the contempt of the proud.
