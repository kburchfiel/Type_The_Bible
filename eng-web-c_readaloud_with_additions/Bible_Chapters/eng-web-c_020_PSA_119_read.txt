Chapter 119.
ALEPH Blessed are those whose ways are blameless, who walk according to the LORD’s law. 
Blessed are those who keep his statutes, who seek him with their whole heart. 
Yes, they do nothing wrong. They walk in his ways. 
You have commanded your precepts, that we should fully obey them. 
Oh that my ways were steadfast to obey your statutes! 
Then I wouldn’t be disappointed, when I consider all of your commandments. 
I will give thanks to you with uprightness of heart, when I learn your righteous judgments. 
I will observe your statutes. Don’t utterly forsake me. 
BETH How can a young man keep his way pure? By living according to your word. 
With my whole heart I have sought you. Don’t let me wander from your commandments. 
I have hidden your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you. 
Blessed are you, LORD. Teach me your statutes. 
With my lips, I have declared all the ordinances of your mouth. 
I have rejoiced in the way of your testimonies, as much as in all riches. 
I will meditate on your precepts, and consider your ways. 
I will delight myself in your statutes. I will not forget your word. 
GIMEL Do good to your servant. I will live and I will obey your word. 
Open my eyes, that I may see wondrous things out of your law. 
I am a stranger on the earth. Don’t hide your commandments from me. 
My soul is consumed with longing for your ordinances at all times. 
You have rebuked the proud who are cursed, who wander from your commandments. 
Take reproach and contempt away from me, for I have kept your statutes. 
Though princes sit and slander me, your servant will meditate on your statutes. 
Indeed your statutes are my delight, and my counselors. 
DALETH My soul is laid low in the dust. Revive me according to your word! 
I declared my ways, and you answered me. Teach me your statutes. 
Let me understand the teaching of your precepts! Then I will meditate on your wondrous works. 
My soul is weary with sorrow; strengthen me according to your word. 
Keep me from the way of deceit. Grant me your law graciously! 
I have chosen the way of truth. I have set your ordinances before me. 
I cling to your statutes, LORD. Don’t let me be disappointed. 
I run in the path of your commandments, for you have set my heart free. 
HE Teach me, LORD, the way of your statutes. I will keep them to the end. 
Give me understanding, and I will keep your law. Yes, I will obey it with my whole heart. 
Direct me in the path of your commandments, for I delight in them. 
Turn my heart toward your statutes, not toward selfish gain. 
Turn my eyes away from looking at worthless things. Revive me in your ways. 
Fulfill your promise to your servant, that you may be feared. 
Take away my disgrace that I dread, for your ordinances are good.

Before I was afflicted, I went astray; but now I observe your word. 
You are good, and do good. Teach me your statutes.

KAPF My soul faints for your salvation. I hope in your word. 
My eyes fail for your word. I say, “When will you comfort me?” 
For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke. I don’t forget your statutes. 
How many are the days of your servant? When will you execute judgment on those who persecute me? 
The proud have dug pits for me, contrary to your law. 
All of your commandments are faithful. They persecute me wrongfully. Help me! 
They had almost wiped me from the earth, but I didn’t forsake your precepts. 
Preserve my life according to your loving kindness, so I will obey the statutes of your mouth. 
LAMEDH LORD, your word is settled in heaven forever. 
Your faithfulness is to all generations. You have established the earth, and it remains.
