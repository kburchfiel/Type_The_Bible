Colossians.
Chapter 4.
Masters, give to your servants that which is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven. 
Continue steadfastly in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving, 
praying together for us also, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds, 
that I may reveal it as I ought to speak. 
Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time. 
Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one. 
All my affairs will be made known to you by Tychicus, the beloved brother, faithful servant, and fellow bondservant in the Lord. 
I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts, 
together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you everything that is going on here. 
Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, greets you, and Mark the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you received instructions, “if he comes to you, receive him”), 
and Jesus who is called Justus. These are my only fellow workers for God’s Kingdom who are of the circumcision, men who have been a comfort to me. 
Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always striving for you in his prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God. 
For I testify about him that he has great zeal for you, and for those in Laodicea, and for those in Hierapolis. 
Luke the beloved physician and Demas greet you. 
Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea, with Nymphas and the assembly that is in his house. 
When this letter has been read among you, cause it to be read also in the assembly of the Laodiceans, and that you also read the letter from Laodicea. 
Tell Archippus, “Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.” 
I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you. Amen.
