the children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty-two. 
Of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Hakkoz, and the children of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name. 
These sought their place among those who were registered by genealogy, but they were not found; therefore they were deemed disqualified and removed from the priesthood. 
The governor told them that they should not eat of the most holy things until a priest stood up to serve with Urim and with Thummim. 
The whole assembly together was forty-two thousand three hundred sixty, 
in addition to their male servants and their female servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty-seven; and they had two hundred singing men and singing women. 
Their horses were seven hundred thirty-six; their mules, two hundred forty-five; 
their camels, four hundred thirty-five; their donkeys, six thousand seven hundred twenty. 
Some of the heads of fathers’ households, when they came to the LORD’s house which is in Jerusalem, offered willingly for God’s house to set it up in its place. 
They gave according to their ability into the treasury of the work sixty-one thousand darics of gold, five thousand minas of silver, and one hundred priests’ garments. 
So the priests and the Levites, with some of the people, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants, lived in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.
