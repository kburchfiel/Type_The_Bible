Tobit.
Chapter 9.
And Tobias called Raphael, and said to him, 
“Brother Azarias, take with you a servant and two camels, and go to Rages of Media to Gabael, and receive the money for me, and bring him to the wedding feast, 
because Raguel has sworn that I must not depart. 
My father counts the days; and if I wait long, he will be very grieved. 
So Raphael went on his way, and lodged with Gabael, and gave him the handwriting; so he brought forth the bags with their seals, and gave them to him. 
Then they rose up early in the morning together, and came to the wedding feast. Tobias blessed his wife.
