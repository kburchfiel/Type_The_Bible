Psalms.
Chapter 101.
A Psalm by David. I will sing of loving kindness and justice. To you, LORD, I will sing praises. 
I will be careful to live a blameless life. When will you come to me? I will walk within my house with a blameless heart. 
I will set no vile thing before my eyes. I hate the deeds of faithless men. They will not cling to me. 
A perverse heart will be far from me. I will have nothing to do with evil. 
I will silence whoever secretly slanders his neighbor. I won’t tolerate one who is arrogant and conceited. 
My eyes will be on the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me. He who walks in a perfect way, he will serve me. 
He who practices deceit won’t dwell within my house. He who speaks falsehood won’t be established before my eyes. 
Morning by morning, I will destroy all the wicked of the land, to cut off all the workers of iniquity from the LORD’s city.
