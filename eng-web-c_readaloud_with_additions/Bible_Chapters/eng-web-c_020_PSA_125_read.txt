Psalms.
Chapter 125.
A Song of Ascents. Those who trust in the LORD are as Mount Zion, which can’t be moved, but remains forever. 
As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds his people from this time forward and forever more. 
For the scepter of wickedness won’t remain over the allotment of the righteous, so that the righteous won’t use their hands to do evil. 
Do good, LORD, to those who are good, to those who are upright in their hearts. 
But as for those who turn away to their crooked ways, the LORD will lead them away with the workers of iniquity. Peace be on Israel.
