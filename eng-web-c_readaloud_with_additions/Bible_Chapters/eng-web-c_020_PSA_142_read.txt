Psalms.
Chapter 142.
A contemplation by David, when he was in the cave. A Prayer. I cry with my voice to the LORD. With my voice, I ask the LORD for mercy. 
I pour out my complaint before him. I tell him my troubles. 
When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, you knew my route. On the path in which I walk, they have hidden a snare for me. 
Look on my right, and see; for there is no one who is concerned for me. Refuge has fled from me. No one cares for my soul. 
I cried to you, LORD. I said, “You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.” 
Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need. Deliver me from my persecutors, for they are too strong for me. 
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks to your name. The righteous will surround me, for you will be good to me.
