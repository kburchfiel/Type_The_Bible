Psalms.
Chapter 57.
For the Chief Musician. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A poem by David, when he fled from Saul, in the cave. Be merciful to me, God, be merciful to me, for my soul takes refuge in you. Yes, in the shadow of your wings, I will take refuge, until disaster has passed. 
I cry out to God Most High, to God who accomplishes my requests for me. 
He will send from heaven, and save me, he rebukes the one who is pursuing me. Selah. God will send out his loving kindness and his truth. 
My soul is among lions. I lie among those who are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword. 
Be exalted, God, above the heavens! Let your glory be above all the earth! 
They have prepared a net for my steps. My soul is bowed down. They dig a pit before me. They fall into the middle of it themselves. Selah. 
My heart is steadfast, God. My heart is steadfast. I will sing, yes, I will sing praises. 
Wake up, my glory! Wake up, lute and harp! I will wake up the dawn. 
I will give thanks to you, Lord, among the peoples. I will sing praises to you among the nations. 
For your great loving kindness reaches to the heavens, and your truth to the skies. 
Be exalted, God, above the heavens. Let your glory be over all the earth.
