Exodus.
Chapter 6.
The LORD said to Moses, “Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh, for by a strong hand he shall let them go, and by a strong hand he shall drive them out of his land.” 
God spoke to Moses, and said to him, “I am the LORD. 
I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name the LORD I was not known to them. 
I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their travels, in which they lived as aliens. 
Moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered my covenant. 
Therefore tell the children of Israel, ‘I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments. 
I will take you to myself for a people. I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. 
I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for a heritage: I am the LORD.’” 
Moses spoke so to the children of Israel, but they didn’t listen to Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage. 
The LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 
“Go in, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.” 
Moses spoke before the LORD, saying, “Behold, the children of Israel haven’t listened to me. How then shall Pharaoh listen to me, when I have uncircumcised lips?” 
The LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a command to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

These are those who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt. These are that Moses and Aaron. 
On the day when the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt, 
The LORD said to Moses, “I am the LORD. Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I tell you.” 
Moses said before the LORD, “Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh listen to me?”
