Job.
Chapter 25.
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered, 
“Dominion and fear are with him. He makes peace in his high places. 
Can his armies be counted? On whom does his light not arise? 
How then can man be just with God? Or how can he who is born of a woman be clean? 
Behold, even the moon has no brightness, and the stars are not pure in his sight; 
How much less man, who is a worm, and the son of man, who is a worm!”
